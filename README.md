## Topic

_Quantum intermediate representations_

[Intermediate representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation) (IR) are the data structure or code used internally by a compiler or virtual machine to represent source code.
Quantum programs can also benefit from IR that can make it easier to build optimization tools and connectors between different front and back ends for quantum programming.
The [qcor](https://qcor.ornl.gov/) project is a good overview of how the connections between the different layers of the quantum software stack.

### Examples of IR for quantum programming
